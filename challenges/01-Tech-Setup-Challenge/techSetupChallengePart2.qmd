# 📊 Tech Setup Challenge - Part 2: Quarto & Python Environment

## Prerequisites ✅

**Before starting Part 2, make sure you've completed Part 1:**

- [ ] Cursor AI installed and configured
- [ ] Git set up in Cursor AI (Source Control)
- [ ] GitHub account created
- [ ] Course materials forked and cloned
- [ ] Student folder created with README.md
- [ ] Initial pull request submitted

## Part 2: Quarto & Python Environment Setup 🐍

### Why Quarto?

Quarto is essential for creating **professional reports** that combine:

- **Text** (like this document)
- **Code** (Python/R analysis)
- **Visualizations** (charts, graphs)
- **Interactive elements** (dashboards)

It's not just for code - it's for creating beautiful, reproducible documents that are perfect for business presentations and reports.

### 1. 📚 Install Quarto

- Go to [quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- Download and install Quarto for your operating system
- Verify installation: Open terminal/command prompt and type `quarto --version`

- **💡 Recommended:** Install the Quarto extension in Cursor AI for better editing experience:
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions (from within Cursor AI)
  - Search for "Quarto"
  - Install the "Quarto" extension by Quarto
  - **Why?** This gives you syntax highlighting, live preview, and better editing support for `.qmd` files

### 2. 🆕 Create Your Own GitHub Repository

**Why Create a Separate Repository?**

Creating your own repository for Quarto projects is a best practice that:
- Keeps your work organized and separate from course materials
- Allows you to showcase your portfolio publicly
- Teaches you proper project management
- Enables GitHub Pages for hosting your documents

**Create a New Repository on GitHub:**

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and make sure you're logged in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner → "New repository"
3. **Repository settings:**
   - **Repository name:** `your-nickname-quarto-portfolio` (e.g., `johnD-quarto-portfolio`)
   - **Description:** "My Quarto data visualization portfolio"
   - **Visibility:** Public (so you can use GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize with:** Check "Add a README file"
4. **Click "Create repository"**

### 3. 📥 Clone Your New Repository

**Clone to Your Computer:**

1. **In Cursor AI:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Git: Clone"
2. **Paste your repository URL:** `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-nickname-quarto-portfolio`
3. **Choose location:** Save it somewhere easy to find (like `C:\` or your Documents folder)
4. **Open the cloned repository** in Cursor AI

### 4. 🐍 Set Up Python Virtual Environment

**Why Virtual Environments?**
Virtual environments keep your Python packages organized and prevent conflicts between different projects. Each project can have its own set of packages without interfering with others.

**Create a Virtual Environment:**

1. **Open Terminal in Cursor AI:**
   - Press `Ctrl + `` (backtick key, usually under the Esc key) to open the integrated terminal
   - OR go to the top menu: **Terminal** → **New Terminal**

2. **You should already be in your repository folder** (if not, navigate to it)

3. **Create Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - This creates a folder called `venv` with a clean Python environment

4. **Activate Virtual Environment:**

   **First, identify your terminal type:**
   - **Command Prompt (cmd):** Prompt shows `C:\>` or similar with backslash paths
   - **PowerShell:** Prompt shows `PS C:\>` with "PS" at the beginning
   - **Git Bash:** Prompt shows `user@computer MINGW64` or similar
   - **Mac/Linux Terminal:** Prompt shows `user@computer:~$` or similar

   **Then use the appropriate command:**
   - **Windows Command Prompt (cmd):**
     ```cmd
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Windows PowerShell:**
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
     - **Note:** If you get an execution policy error, run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
   - **Windows Git Bash:**
     ```bash
     source venv/Scripts/activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux Terminal:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   
   **Success indicator:** You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt

5. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pandas jupyter
   ```

6. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import matplotlib, pandas, jupyter; print('All packages installed successfully!')"
   ```
   - You should see: "All packages installed successfully!"
   - If you get an error, try: `pip install --upgrade pip` then reinstall the packages

### 5. 🎯 Configure Cursor to Auto-Activate Environment

**Important:** Keep your terminal open with the virtual environment activated while you complete the next steps.

**Set Python Interpreter (Project-Specific):**

1. **Make sure you have your repository folder open** in Cursor (not just a single file)
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Choose the interpreter from your virtual environment:
   - **Windows:** Look for `.\venv\Scripts\python.exe`
   - **Mac/Linux:** Look for `./venv/bin/python`
   - **Important:** Make sure it shows the path to YOUR project's `venv` folder
5. **Why?** This tells Cursor to use your virtual environment's Python and packages for THIS project only

**💡 Pro Tip:** Cursor will remember this setting for this specific project folder. When you open this repository in the future, it will automatically use the correct virtual environment!

**Verify Setup:**

- Open a new terminal in Cursor
- You should see `(venv)` in the prompt automatically
- Type `python -c "import matplotlib; print('Matplotlib installed successfully!')"`

### 6. 📱 Install Live Preview Extension

**Why Live Preview?**

Live Preview allows you to see your HTML documents update in real-time as you make changes, making development much faster and more interactive.

**Install the Extension:**

1. **Open Extensions:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` in Cursor
2. **Search for:** "Live Preview"
3. **Install:** "Live Preview" by Microsoft
4. **Why?** This extension lets you preview HTML files directly in Cursor with live updates

### 7. 📊 Create Your First Data Visualization

**Create a Quarto Document with Matplotlib:**

1. **Create a new file** in your repository called `index.qmd` (this will be your main portfolio page)

2. **Add this content** (replace bracketed text with your nickname):

::: {.callout-note}
## 🎭 YAML Front-Matter: The Secret Sauce

**What you're about to see** (between the `---` lines) is called **YAML front-matter** - and yes, YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" (because the original acronym was "Yet Another Markup Language" and they got meta with it! 🤯).

Think of it as the **control panel** for your Quarto document - it's where you tell Quarto how to dress up your content. Want HTML? PDF? Should code run or just show? It's all configured here in this little language-within-a-language that makes your markdown document go from "meh" to "WOW!" ✨
:::

Copy and paste this content into your `index.qmd` file:

# Welcome to My Portfolio! 📊

Hello! My nickname is [YourNickNameLastInitial]. This is my Quarto data visualization portfolio showcasing my Python and matplotlib skills.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates how Quarto can seamlessly integrate Python code and visualizations into professional documents. Each chart below is created using matplotlib and embedded directly into this document.

## Simple Line Chart

Let's create a simple line chart showing some sample data:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 4.75))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2, label='sin(x)')
plt.xlabel('X values')
plt.ylabel('Y values')
plt.title('My First Matplotlib Chart')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Bar Chart Example

Here's a bar chart showing some sample data:

```{python}
# Sample data for bar chart
categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
values = [23, 45, 56, 78, 32]

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 4.75))
bars = plt.bar(categories, values, color=['red', 'green', 'blue', 'orange', 'purple'])
plt.xlabel('Categories')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.title('Sample Bar Chart')

# Add value labels on bars
for bar, value in zip(bars, values):
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, bar.get_height() + 1, 
             str(value), ha='center', va='bottom')

plt.show()
```
